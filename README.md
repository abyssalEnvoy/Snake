A small Nokia-like Snake made over the summer to learn C# and FNA.

Play the game on my [itch.io](https://abyssalenvoy.itch.io/snake-ii) page.

## Building from source

Use ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/abyssalEnvoy/Snake``` to also download FNA.

Build and place fnalibs (found here https://fna.flibitijibibo.com/archive/fnalibs.tar.bz2) next to executable.
